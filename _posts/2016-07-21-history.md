  Hi,  I am Stefan Van den Bossche, guitarist. Together with vocalist Gwen
  Taylor we are MangoA.  This is our story.  While both living in Brussels Gwen
  joined my band Hot Streets. A while later the band dissolved and we continued
  as a duo, playing the festival circuit, cultural centres and jazz clubs. To
  make ends meet I worked as a computer engineer, and Gwen was in demand as a
  studio singer for commercials.

Hi,   
I am Stefan Van den Bossche, guitarist. Together with vocalist Gwen Taylor we are MangoA.   
This is our story.   
While both living in Brussels Gwen joined my band Hot Streets. A while later the band dissolved and we continued as a duo, playing the festival circuit, cultural centres and jazz clubs. To make ends meet I worked as a computer engineer, and Gwen was in demand as a studio singer for commercials.
