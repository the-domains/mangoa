# Our History

## Hi,   
I am Stefan Van den Bossche, guitarist. Together with vocalist Gwen Taylor we are MangoA.   
This is our story. 

## While both living in Brussels Gwen joined my band Hot Streets. A while later the band dissolved and we continued as a duo, playing the festival circuit, cultural centres and jazz clubs.

## Gwen was born in England, of Barbadian parents, and spent her teenage-years in Barbados. Here she picks up singing while attending church, and in the school choir.

## I was born in Brussels, Belgium and started fooling around with music from an early age...

## ... but only got serious about music when I discovered the guitar.

## In the meantime Gwen and I recorded demo's to shop around.
